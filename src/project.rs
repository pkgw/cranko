//! Here, a project is defined as something thatâ€™s assigned version numbers.
//! Many repositories contain only a single project, but in the general case
//! (i.e., a monorepo) there can be many projects within a single repo, with
//! interdependencies inducing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure on them,
//! as implemented in the `graph` module.
