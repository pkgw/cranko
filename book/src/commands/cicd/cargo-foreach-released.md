# `cranko cargo foreach-released`

Run a Rust [cargo] command for all Rust/Cargo projects that have
had new releases.

[cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

#### Usage

```
cranko cargo foreach-released [--command-name=COMMAND] [--] [CARGO-ARGS...]
```

This command should be run in CI processing of an update to the `rc` branch,
after the release has been vetted and the release commit has been created. The
current branch should be the `release` branch.

#### Example

```shell
$ cranko cargo foreach-released -- publish --no-verify
```

Note that the name of `cargo` itself should *not* be one of the arguments.
Furthermore, due to the way that Cranko parses its command-line arguments, if
any option flags are to be passed to Cargo, you must precede the whole set of
Cargo options with a double-dash (`--`). The example above would run [`cargo
publish --no-verify`][cargo-publish] for each released package â€” which is
basically the whole reason that this command exists.

Automated publishing requires a Cargo API token. Ideally, such tokens should not
be included in command-line arguments. The [`cargo publish`][cargo-publish]
command can obtain tokens from the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` environment variable
(for the [Crates.io] registry) or `CARGO_REGISTRIES_${NAME}_TOKEN` for other
registries. See [the `cargo publish` docs][cargo-publish] for the official
documentation.

The `--command-name` argument can be used to specify a different command to be
run instead of the default `cargo`. For instance, one might use
`--command-name=cross` for certain operations in a cross-compiled build using
the [rust-embedded/cross] framework.
