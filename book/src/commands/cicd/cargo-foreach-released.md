# `cranko cargo foreach-released`

Run a Rust [cargo] command for all Rust/Cargo projects that have
had new releases.

[cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

#### Usage

```
cranko cargo foreach-released [CARGO-ARGS...]
```

This command should be run in CI processing of an update to the `rc` branch,
after the release has been vetted and the release commit has been created. The
current branch should be the `release` branch.

#### Example

```shell
$ cranko cargo foreach-released publish
```

Note that the name of the `cargo` program should *not* be one of the arguments.
The example above would run [`cargo publish`][cargo-publish] for each released
package â€” which is basically the whole reason that this command exists.

Automated publishing requires a Cargo API token. Ideally, such tokens should not
be included in command-line arguments. The [`cargo publish`][cargo-publish]
command can obtain tokens from the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` environment variable
(for the [Crates.io] registry) or `CARGO_REGISTRIES_${NAME}_TOKEN` for other
registries. See [the `cargo publish` docs][cargo-publish] for the official
documentation.
