# `cranko diff`

Print a [diff] comparing the last release of a project to the state of the
current working tree.

[diff]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff

#### Usage

```
cranko diff [PROJECT-NAME]
```

You can leave `[PROJECT-NAME]` unspecified if there's only one project in the
repo.

#### Example

```shell
$ cranko diff
diff --git a/Cargo.lock b/Cargo.lock
index 41bc0b8..02069cd 100644
--- a/Cargo.lock
+++ b/Cargo.lock

```

#### Remarks

This command is helpful to get an overview of the changes that have occurred
since the last release. It farms out its work to the `git diff` subcommand,
executing a command of the form:

```shell
$ git diff [COMMIT] -- [DIR]
```

where `[COMMIT]` is last the main-branch commit included in the most recent
release of the project in question, and `[DIR]` is the primary working directory
associated with that project. In other words, this command is different than
`git diff` because it compares against the most recent *release* commit, as
opposed to the most recent commit of any kind. It also filters the diff output
by repository path.
